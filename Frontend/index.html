          How to Workout in College. Every day is a chance to become better
        </h3>
        <p>
          When it comes to maintaining their health, college students have a lot
          working against them. There is the strain of heavy workloads and
          coursework. There's also that newly discovered independence, which can
          manifest itself in harmful ways, such as all-you-can-eat meal plans
          and working all night. Fortunately, schools and universities are
          making a lot of effort to assist their students in becoming and being
          in shape. This manual offers guidance on gaining and preserving
          fitness and good health during college and beyond.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">How Much Exercise Do College Students Need?</h3>
        <p>
          Two essential components of a well-rounded, healthy fitness programme
          for adults are cardio activity and strength training. And for a lot of
          people, frequent stretching is a crucial component of their routine.
          The recommended amount of exercise for college students is listed
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><u>Please note:</u></b> Before beginning any new exercise
          programme, you should always see your doctor. These are generic
          suggestions, so they don't account for any health issues or worries
          you might have.

            <p>
              What it is: Also referred to as aerobic exercise, this is any form
              of physical activity that works the legs and other big muscle
              groups repeatedly while raising the heart
              <rate class="br"

            <h3><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Stretching</h3>
            <p>
              What it is: Exercises that purposefully stretch or flex particular
              muscles are referred to as stretching. What it does for you:
              According to the BBC and the New York Times, there is very little
              data to support the health advantages of stretching before or
              after exercise. However, a lot of people think it can boost
              flexibility, enhance musculoskeletal function and range of motion,
              and aid in preventing physical harm. Stretching not only improves
              your health but also makes a lot of individuals feel
              better.Example Exercises: There are several types of stretching
              exercises. 
              <!-- Common types include: Static stretching: Stretching a
              muscle to its farthest point and holding it there for a short
              period of time, typically 30 seconds or more. Passive stretching:
              Similar to static stretching except a device or partner provides
              the stretching force. Dynamic stretching: Controlled leg and arm
              swinging, gradually increasing speed and/or reach. Ballistic
              stretching: Employs the momentum of the body (bouncing) to stretch
              the body part beyond its normal range of motion. Only recommended
              for highly-conditioned athletes. Active isolated stretching:
              Involves taking and holding a position using only the strength of
              one's own muscles. -->

            <h3><i class="fas fa-check"></i>HIIT workout</h3>
            <p>
              High-intensity interval training, or HIIT, is a type of interval
              training that consists of short bursts of extremely intense
              activity followed by rest intervals or periods of lower intensity
              exercise. It delivers the same health advantages as low- and
              moderate-intensity aerobic workouts in a lot less time and has
              been shown to increase metabolism and build strength. Basically,
              both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are more affected by
              high-intensity interval training. Therefore, spread out your
              training mat, clean off your dumbbells (if you have them,) and
              choose one of the high-intensity exercises below. 
              <!-- If you're afraid
              about being spotted jumping, tucking, pressing, and pushing your
              way to HIIT-fitness, close your curtains. Then get started! -->

            <h3>body building</h3>
            <p>
              A question nearly every beginner asks: how many hours of training
              should you average a week to become bigger and more defined? The
              answer is this: it really depends on your training splits. There
              are a number of ways, however, you can tackle them – for example,
              splitting them by upper and lower body exercises or focusing on
              push and pull motions – and then even more ways of scheduling
              them: every other day, four days on three days off, and so on.

              There is no age limit for gym. But if you really want to hit the
              gym, you need to be at least 14 to 15 years old, though you should
              refrain from heavy lifting and concentrate on doing body weight
              exercises, yoga etc. If you want to lift weights, you could start
              off with light weights as your bones are still growing.

              Women experience pressure to be flawless in college. Instagram is
              flooded with fitness models who have flawless bodies, making it
              appear impossible for college students to match them. The gym can
              be scary for women, particularly for those who are just starting
              out in the fitness world.
